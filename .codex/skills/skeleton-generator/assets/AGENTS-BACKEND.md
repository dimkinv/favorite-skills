# Agent Instructions (Backend)

- Follow SOLID principles and keep clear separation of concerns.
- Keep the project minimal and runnable with TypeScript, with a single entrypoint and small modules.
- Use tsx for dev and tsc for build output to dist/.
- Prefer explicit, testable boundaries for config, domain logic, and I/O.
